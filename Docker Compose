This is my second blog, that explains about the Docker Compose and Running Multiple Containers using Docker Compose.
Docker Compose is a tool for defining and running multi-container Docker applications. It enables developers to manage multiple containers as a single application, simplifying the process of building, testing, and deploying complex applications. With Docker Compose, developers can define and configure the services that make up their application in a single file, and then start, stop, and scale those services using a single command. This modularity allows developers to easily manage multiple containers simultaneously, resulting in efficient development, testing, and deployment processes.
